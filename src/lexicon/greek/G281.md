- firm
  - metaphorically faithful
- verily, amen

### Note

It was a custom, which passed over from the synagogues to the Christian assemblies, that when he who had read or discoursed, had offered up solemn prayer to God, the others responded "Amen," and thus made the substance of what was uttered their own.
