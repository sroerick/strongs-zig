from [[G4012]] and the base of [[G5114]]; to cut around, i.e., (specially) to circumcise; circumcise.

- to cut around
- to circumcise
  - cut off one's prepuce (used of that well known rite by which not only the male children of the Israelites, on the eighth day after birth, but subsequently also &quot;proselytes of righteousness&quot; were consecrated to Jehovah and introduced into the number of his people)
  - to get one's self circumcised, present one's self to be circumcised, receive circumcision
  - since by the rite of circumcision a man was separated from the unclean world and dedicated to God, the word is transferred to denote the extinguishing of lusts and the removal of sins
