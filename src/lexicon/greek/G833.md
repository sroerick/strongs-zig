# G833 αὐλή

## aulḗ

_(ow-lay' | ev-LAY | a-LAY)_

### Definition

from the same as [[G109]]; a yard (as open to the wind); by implication, a mansion; court, (sheep-)fold, hall, palace.

- uncovered space around the house, enclosed by a wall, in which the stables stood (i.e., a sheepfold)
- the uncovered court-yard of the house
- the house itself, a palace

### Note

In the Old Testament this refers to the courts of the tabernacle and of the temple in Jerusalem. The dwellings of the higher classes usually had two, one exterior, between the door and the street; the other interior, surrounded by the buildings of the dwelling itself. The latter is mentioned Matthew 26:69.
