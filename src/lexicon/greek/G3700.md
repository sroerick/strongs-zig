## optánomai

_(op-tan'-om-ahee | oh-PTA-noh-meh | oh-PTA-noh-may)_

### Definition

a (middle voice) prolonged form of the primary (middle voice) ὄπτομαι; which is used for it in certain tenses; and both as alternate of [[G3708]]; to gaze (i.e., with wide-open eyes, as at something remarkable; and thus differing from [[G991]], which denotes simply voluntary observation; and from [[G1492]], which expresses merely mechanical, passive or casual vision; while [[G2300]], and still more emphatically its intensive [[G2334]], signifies an earnest but more continued inspection; and [[G4648]] a watching from a distance); appear, look, see, shew self.

- to look at, behold
- to allow one's self to be seen, to appear
