_(hrayg'-noo-mee | RAY-gnoo-mee | RAY-gnyoo-mee)_

### Definition

both prolonged forms of ῥήκω (which appears only in certain forms, and is itself probably a strengthened form of agnumi (see in [[G2608]])); to "break," "wreck" or "crack", i.e., (especially) to sunder (by separation of the parts; [[G2608]] being its intensive (with the preposition in composition), and [[G2352]] a shattering to minute fragments; but not a reduction to the constituent particles, like [[G3089]]) or disrupt, lacerate; by implication, to convulse (with spasms); figuratively, to give vent to joyful emotions; break (forth), burst, rend, tear.

    - into joy, of infants or dumb persons beginning to speak
