# G1220 δηνάριον

## dēnárion

_(day-nar'-ee-on | thay-NA-ree-one | thay-NA-ree-one)_

### Definition

containing ten; of Latin origin; a denarius (or ten asses); pence, penny(-worth).

- A Roman silver coin in New Testament time

### Note

It took its name from it being equal to ten "asses," a number after 217 BC increased to sixteen (about 3.898 grams or .1375 oz.). It was the principal silver coin of the Roman empire. From the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, it would seem that a denarius was then the ordinary pay for a day's wages (see Matthew 20:2–13).
