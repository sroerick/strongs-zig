# G4441 πυνθάνομαι

## pynthánomai

_(poon-than'-om-ahee | poon-THA-noh-meh | pyoon-THA-noh-may)_

### Definition

middle voice prolonged from a primary πύθω (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); to question, i.e., ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely; and thus differing from [[G2065]], which properly means a request as a favor; and from [[G154]], which is strictly a demand for something due; as well as from [[G2212]], which implies a search for something hidden; and from [[G1189]], which involves the idea of urgent need); by implication, to learn (by casual intelligence); ask, demand, enquire, understand.

- to enquire, ask
- to ascertain, by enquiry
