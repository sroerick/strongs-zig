## aspázomai

_(as-pad'-zom-ahee | ah-SPA-zoh-meh | ah-SPA-zoh-may)_

### Definition

from [[G1]] (as a particle of union) and a presumed form of [[G4685]]; to enfold in the arms, i.e., (by implication) to salute, (figuratively) to welcome; embrace, greet, salute, take leave.

- to draw to one's self
  - to salute one, greet, bid welcome, wish well to
  - to receive joyfully, welcome

### Note

Used of those accosting anyone; of those who visit one to see him a little while, departing almost immediately afterwards; to pay respects to a distinguished person by visiting him; of those who greet one whom they meet in the way (even not in the East, Christians and Mohammedans do not greet one another); a salutation was made not merely by a slight gesture and a few words, but generally by embracing and kissing, a journey was retarded frequently by saluting.
