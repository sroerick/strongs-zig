## hēméra

_(hay-mer'-ah | hay-MEH-ra | ay-MAY-ra)_

### Definition

feminine (with [[G5610]] implied) of a derivative of ἧμαι (to sit; akin to the base of [[G1476]]) meaning tame, i.e. gentle; day, i.e., (literally) the time space between dawn and dark, or the whole 24 hours (but several days were usually reckoned by the Jews as inclusive of the parts of both extremes); figuratively, a period (always defined more or less clearly by the context); age, [[lexicon-key|+]] alway, (mid-)day (by day), daily, [[lexicon-key|+]] for ever, judgment, (day) time, while, years.

- the day, used of the natural day, or the interval between sunrise and sunset, as distinguished from and contrasted with the night
  - in the daytime
  - metaphorically, &quot;the day&quot; is regarded as the time for abstaining from indulgence, vice, crime, because acts of the sort are perpetrated at night and in darkness
- of the civil day, or the space of twenty four hours (thus including the night)
- of the last day of this present age, the day Christ will return from heaven, raise the dead, hold the final judgment, and perfect his kingdom
- used of time in general, i.e., the days of his life.

### Note

Any part of a day is counted as a whole day; therefore the expression "three days and three nights" does not mean literally three whole days but rather at least one whole day plus part of two other days. It is evident that this is an idiom used by the Jews, even in Old Testament times (compare 1 Samuel 30:12 against 1 Samuel 30:13 and Esther 4:16 against Esther 5:1).
