# H3999 מַבּוּל / מבול

## mabbûwl

_(mab-bool' | mahb-BOOL | ma-BOOL)_

### Definition

masculine noun; from [[H2986]] in the sense of flowing; a deluge; flood.

- flood, deluge.
    - Noah's flood that submerged the entire planet earth under water for about a year


### Note

Some think Noah's flood was only local; however the description of it found in Genesis 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. With the possible exception of Psalm 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood.
