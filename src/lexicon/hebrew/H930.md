# H930 בְּהֵמוֹת / בהמות

## bᵉhêmôwth

_(be-hay-mohth' | beh-hay-MOTE | beh-hay-MOTE)_

### Definition

masculine noun; in form a plural or [[H929]], but really a singular of Egyptian derivation; a dinosaur; Behemoth.

- perhaps an extinct dinosaur
    - a Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus, exact meaning unknown


### Note

Some translate this as elephant or hippopotamus, but from the description in Job 40:15-24, this is patently absurd. With a "tail like a cedar," certainly this creature must have been much larger than any animal known today; however it is clear from the text that Job was aware of this giant beast.
