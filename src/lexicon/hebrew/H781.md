## ʼâras

_(aw-ras' | aw-RAHS | ah-RAHS)_

### Definition

verb; a primitive root; to promise to marry; betroth, espouse.

- to betroth, engage
    - (Piel) to betroth (man or woman)
    - (Pual) to be betrothed


### Note

Unlike modern day engagement, betrothal always ends in marriage. Consider how Joseph intended to put Mary away privately instead of calling off the marriage (Matthew 1:19).
