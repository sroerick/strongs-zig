# H4327 מִין / מין

## mîyn

_(meen | meen | meen)_

### Definition

masculine noun; from an unused root meaning to portion out; a sort, i.e., species; kind.

- kind, sometimes a species (usually of animals)


### Note

Groups of living organisms belong in the same created "kind" if they have descended from the same ancestral gene pool. This does not preclude new species because this represents a partitioning of the original gene pool. Information is lost or conserved, not gained. A new species could arise when a population is isolated and inbreeding occurs. By this definition, a new species is not a new "kind" but a further partitioning of an existing "kind." Compare [[H4480]].
