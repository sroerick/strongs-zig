## Abbreviations

- **TWOT** = *Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament*, edited by R. Laird Harris, Gleason L. Archer, Jr., and Bruce K. Waltke. TWOT deals with the Hebrew/Aramaic words in the Old Testament that have a theological significance. It gives a short definition to every Old Testament word, but goes theologically in depth on the words that would be necessary.
- **CLBL** = *Concise Lexicon to the Biblical Languages* by Jay Patrick Green. This brief lexicon can even be used instead of the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon when as a quick reference to the meaning and grammatical construction of a word.
- **BDB** = *Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon* by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles A. Briggs. Based upon the classic work of Wilhelm Gesenius, the "father of modern Hebrew lexicography," BDB gives not only dictionary definitions for each word, but relates each word to its Hebrew Bible usage and categorizes its nuances of meaning.
